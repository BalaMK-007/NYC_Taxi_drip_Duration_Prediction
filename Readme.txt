I've added both Ipynb and Pdf files in this folder. Created seperate 
folder for PDF files.

I've faced issues while converting ipynb files to pdf. so converted it 
with the use of external website.

Please Check the IPYNB files which will be more clear and organised.


I've created Benchmark model, KNN model, and Linear Regression 
and plotted the score error with bar plots.

I've done all the four works in seperate files.

I've readed the question and answer section in our portal to clear my doubts.
And utilised those answers and codes from the teachers to create my project.

The Teachers answered, that we don't need to build decision tree model.


I've completely reffered the learning videos and use similar steps for my
project which gives better understanding. So some lines of code from the video
lecture and in my project will be similar but the purpose of those codes are same
so I used it.

Please inform me if I have done any error in the files while the feedback.

Thank YOU......
